HTML/CSS and JavaScript

As part of my learning process at the Tech Academy, I 
wanted to pull what I had learned from HTML and CSS and
add in some dynamic elements with JavaScript and JQuery.

This is an ongoing process, so I am doing my best to keep
my comments in the code up-to-date.

ToDo:
- Advance some elements of the menu system
- Consider some AJAX/JSON for the countdown elements to
  to make one location for storing that data.
- Consider PHP in order to have the nav section stored
  seperately for inclusion.
  
  Any other suggestions, or challenges, to build on my
  learning, would be welcome.
